//two thingg might happen when you make a platformer: when you press on the side of the platformer zhang ai wu it will stick to it on the side if you take friction off it will stick on the top
//in a lot of games you can jump in front of something and land on top of it  with default, you can't jump through the thing instead jumping on top
// the solution of preventing these two from happenning is platformer effector 2d then click on used by effector in inspector

//creatinig a bullet shooting function

/* select any bullet sprite or cube + box collider 2d + rigid body 2d in the inspector

coding <<<<<< on public

public GameObject bulletPrefab;
public int bulletForce = 200; //bullet speed
public Transform spawnPoint;

down in update 

if(Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1")){
GameObeject newBullet = Instantiate(bulletPrefab, spawnPoint.position,Quaternion.identity);
newBullet.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().AddForce(new Vector2 (transform.localScale.x, 0));
_animator.SetTrigger("Shoot");
// add force of the direction where the bullet is shooting at 

}

remember to drag the bulletprefab into the inspector from asset or heiarchy

set gravity of bullet in rigidbody 2d to 0 

remember to drag spawnPoint empty object to the inspector box


animation ---> create new clip ----> shoot 
create a transition from any state to shoot
add perameter ----> trigger ---> called "shoot"
set all of the things in the transition from "any state" to "shoot" to 0
add shooting condition

then create an transition back from "shoot" to "idol state"
this one we will leave the exit time on

a trigger fires once

Add cinemachine from packaged manager
