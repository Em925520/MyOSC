//OSC SENDING MESSAGE CONCEPT


//每次update传一下position        那个vector3 event接收
/*
 *  sending dragon's movement by arudino through osc
 *  
 *  1. write down dragon controller script with the basic movements in start
 *  2. send dragon (player)'s position in update whenever player moves
 *  3. send dragon's data on pressing a button to blow fire 
 *  (if statement that 0 is not blowing fire and 1 is blowing fire once a button is pressed
 *  4. if fire collides with enemy twice, destory(enemy)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * receiving data through osc
 * 
 * 1. detect if the dragon is moving
 * 2. if the dragon is moving in the scene, receive the data of the dragon position
 * 3. detect if dragon is blowing fire or not, if the dragon is blowing-- receiving "1", if dragon is not blowing receiving "0"
 * 4. receiveing data of the #times the fire is blowing colliding with enemy
